    <p>Well, the software development came to my life around my 15 years old, when I used to get "locked" in my room playing MMORPGs haha.. It was when I discovered the PIRATE SERVERS (yay) and I found a guy who called me to make our own server. We tried, but, unfortunately, our partnership didn't last for long...</p>

    <p>I used to develop in C# (it was the best then). Building "if" statements, I thought I knew everything hahaha.</p>

    <p>In 2011 I started my graduation. It took me 4 years to receive my degree. I'm very thankful for my grandma who helped me financially on the first year, from it on I got a scholarship that certainly made me arrive where I am today.</p>

    <p>My first job with development was as an intern, in December 2012, when I met the Ruby language &lt;3 (subsequently I was hired). From that moment onwards I've been a Ruby Developer.</p>

    <p>Subsequently, in 2017, I decided to keep growing up and started my post graduation to become a Specialist in Web Development and Mobile Applications. Two more years to got this title.</p>

    <p>In 2017 I had a chance to share my experience with this language at RubyConf. Me and a teammate presented the talk <i>"Putting your Vue application on Rails"</i>. It was awesome!</p>

    <p>What is development for me? Development is to exercise the mind, solve problems, create solutions, work with logic, and of course, I love that.</p>
