    <p>Software development became a part of my life around my 15 years old, when I used to spend countless hours locked in my room playing MMORPGs (haha!). It was during this time that I discovered the magical world of the PIRATE SERVERS (yay!). Also, during this period that I was invited by another player create our own server. Although our partnership didn't last for long, it sparked my interest in programming.</p>

    <p>I started my journey in development with C#, building "if" statements, feeling like I knew everything (hahaha).</p>

    <p>In 2011 I started my graduation. It took me 4 years to receive my degree. I am immensely grateful for my grandmaðŸŒ¹who supported me financially on the first year, from thereon, I got a scholarship that certainly made me arrive where I am today.</p>

    <p>My first job in development was as an intern in December 2012, where I met the Ruby language <i class="fa fa-heart text-red"></i>. I was subsequently hired, and ever since, I've been a dedicated Ruby Developer.

    <p>Subsequently, In 2017, I decided to continue my growth and started my post-graduation to become a Specialist in Web Development and Mobile Applications. It took me two more years to earn this title. This was the first opportunity that I had to build a new application from scratch until make it live and available for clients and I had to do every step by my own, which was a rewarding experience.</p>

    <p>It was also during this period that I got an exciting opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with Ruby at RubyConf, where a teammate and I presented the talk <i>"Putting your Vue application on Rails,"</i> and the experience was truly awesome!</p>

    <p>Around the mid of 2022, I took another significant step in my career by founding my own company, <i>ALTF4 Desenvolvimento e Consultoria LTDA</i>, which provides development services to other businesses. This venture opened the door to international experiences that gave me the opportunity to work with a U.S. based company, where I am still employed until the current days.</p>

    <p>Continuing my thirst for learning, I delved into Unity3d game development, acquiring essential skills. As a result, I successfully shipped my first game to Google Play in 2023. Don't forget to check it out in the Projects section; If you are a survivor experiences lover, I'm pretty sure that you'll love it!</p>

    <p>What does development mean to me? I'd say that it is an incredible opportunity to exercise my mind, solve problems, create innovative solutions, work with logic, <i>perform some magical feats</i>, and most importantly, it's something I genuinely love.</p>
